<h2>Linear Thinkertoys</h2>

<div class="group-a">
     
    <h4>The Games</h4>

<!--   <h5 id="false_faces">False Faces</h5>
<p>If you start with incorrect assumptions, your solutions will be poorly constructed.
Edison did not hire people who salted their suit before tasting it. He didn’t like people who had too many assumptions built into life.
Blueprint:
State the challenge
List your assumptions
Challenge fundamental assumptions by reversing them, recording different viewpoints
Ask how to accomplish each reversal. List as many ideas as possible. The goal is not to find one right answer, but look at different ways to view existing info.
Alfred Sloan helped General Motors turn around by pioneering the idea of installment buying for cars.
Ex of a creative idea: “Restaurant with no menu.” Chef makes a dish out of customer-chosen ingredients, and names the dish after the customer.</p>
-->


   <h5 id="slice_dice">Slice and Dice</h5>
<p>Every problem is a house with many rooms.
To solve problems, identify and list different attributes of a problem and work on it one attribute at a time.
How to break down attributes?
Descriptive: Substance, structure, color, texture, sound, taste, space, density, shape
Process: Marketing, selling, function, time, manufacturing
Function: Politics, taboos, responsibilities
Social: Wholesaler, retailer, consumer, manufacturer
Price: Cost to manufacturer, consumer, retailer, wholesaler
Ecological: Impact on the environment, positive or negative
Ex: A pencil — used for writing, yellow, eraser, Charlotte, hexagonal, has printing on it, cylindrical, lead
To invent something better, focus on each attribute and try to improve it. “how else can this be accomplished? Why does it have to be this way?” Go through each attribute one at a time.
Even trivial attributes sometimes provide the clue to a solution. Everything has meaning, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. Even tiny pine needles have a clean fresh smell.
The Opel-Kundt illusion: When you subdivide a box, the squares appear to be wider. When you subdivide a challenge, the nature of the challenge doesn’t change.
Also, listing and clustering attributes can inspire an idea. Make two columns and shuffle them around.
Sometimes ideas are just new information grafted onto an attribute and spliced with another thought.
Ex: Manhattan psychotherapists came up with counseling by mail for shy, housebound, busy patients.</p>

<h5 id="cherry_split">Cherry Split</h5>
<p>Divide a challenge into blocks to reassemble in different ways.
Blueprint:
State the essence of the problem in 2 words. Ex: “cherry picking” instead of “how can we improve the method of picking cherries?”
Split the challenge into 2 units: cherry & picking.
Split each attribute into 2 more attributes. Ex: cherry = delicate, separate. Picking = remove, transport
Continue splitting attributes until you have enough to work with. Ex: delicate = damaged, blemished. Separate = selecting, closeness to each other…
Examine each attribute for ideas.
Reassemble the attributes.
You can turn this into a tree diagram.</p>

<h5 id="think_bubbles">Think Bubbles</h5>
<p>Create a physical picture of the way your mind blueprints a challenge. Map out your ideas. Study it. Put it away for a few days, then try again. Focus on keywords and associations. Use clusters.</p>

<h5 id="scamper">Scamper</h5>
<p>Everything new is just an addition or modification to something that already existed.
Think about how many ways you can answer this question “what is half of thirteen?”
6.5, 6 1/2
four letters on each side
XIII in half = XI / II aka 11 and 2
9 techniques for transforming anything into something new — The SCAMPER method:
Substitute something (rules, ingredients, materials, procedures, power, place, approach, person)
Combine it with something else (ideas, purposes, units, packages, uses, materials, appeals)
Adapt something ( what else is like this? what does this suggest? any past parallels? what can you copy/emulate/incorporate? Processes, contexts, behaviors, fields outside yours…)
Modify or magnify it (extend, make larger, overstate, more time, stronger, higher, longer, frequency, more features, more value, duplicate, dramatic extreme, alter, change name, new twist)
Put it to some other use (think George Washington Carver. Other markets? What could be made from this? Other uses if modified?) Ex: Ed Newton made himself a consultant rather than a salesperson and succeeded in business.
Eliminate something (omit, make smaller, divide, split, understate, streamline, what’s not necessary?)
Reverse or rearrange it (schedule, pattern, pace, components, reverse roles, do the unexpected, what is the opposite of this?) Ex: Invisible Jim, the toy no one can see.
How to use SCAMPER: isolate the challenge, ask SCAMPER questions about each step of the challenge.
Ex: If the challenge is in selling, break it up into the stages: prospecting, presenting, overcoming objections, closing, follow up, time management, paperwork, etc. Then ask SCAMPER questions of each stage.</p>

</div>

<div class="group-b">
<h5 id="tug_war">Tug-of-War</h5>
<p>You must be aware of the positive and negative forces operating in the challenge before you develop a strategy for solving it. Your strategy should let you take advantage of positive factors while eliminating or diminishing negative ones.
Force field analysis: Kurt Lewin. Designed to:
Better define your challenge
ID strengths to maximize
ID weaknesses to minimize
Blueprint:
Write your challenge
Describe best and worst case scenario
List conditions: anything that modifies/restricts the nature/existence of your subject. Requirements essential to solving the challenge
Note the tug of war: What forces push you to best case and pull you to catastrophe
Ex: Challenge = job security.
Conditions = track record, energy level, creativity, dedication, leadership, customer relations.
Best case = promotion, worst case = being fired.
Write it down on a piece of paper, with four columns. Column 1 = best case, column 2 = factors that pull toward best case. Column 3 = factors that pull toward worst case, Column 4 = worst case.
How to move toward best-case scenario:
Maximize strengths
Minimize weaknesses
Add more positive forces
Reframe weaknesses as challenges: In what ways might I improve my creativity?
Maximizing strength is the punch, minimizing weakness is the clever footwork.</p>

<h5 id="idea_box">Idea Box</h5>
<p>Morphological box by Dr. Fritz Zwicky.
Within a set number of cards, there’s a vast number of combos, some good, some useless. The more combos you create, the greater your likelihood of getting a winning hand.
Blueprint:
State the challenge
Select parameters of your challenge: ask, “would the challenge still exist without the parameter I’m considering adding to the box?”
List variations: List as many variations as you want for each parameter.
Try different combinations
Ex: Challenge is to improve design of laundry hampers.
Parameters = material, shape, finish, position. What kinds of materials (wicker, plastic, metal), shapes (square, cylinder, cube), finishes (painted, clear, luminous, neon), positions (on the floor, on wall, on door) can hampers have? Then mix and match different parameters.
We tend to see elements of a challenge as one continuous whole, ignoring relationships between elements. The Idea Box helps you separate the whole into parts and scramble the parts.</p>

<h5 id="idea_grid">Idea Grid</h5>
<p>Ponzo illusion: We try to comprehend images as a whole.
FCB Grid: enables one to compress large amounts of complex info. Rank your product on a grid based on high/low involvement and thinking/feeling (what it appeals to in your customers).
Place competitor products on the grid too.</p>

<h5 id="lotus">Lotus Blossom</h5>
<p>We need an oceanic view of our problems rather than a frog-in-the-well limited view. Look at lotus blossom petals/themes around the core of your issue.
Write your problem in the center of a diagram, write significant components/themes of your subject in a circle outside the center circle, labeled A-H (6–8 themes. If you have more, make additional diagrams).
Ask: What are your specific objectives? What are the constants in your problem? What would your chapter headings be if this were a book?
Use ideas in the circles as central themes for more lotus blossom petals. This way you can track whole systems of interacting elements.</p>

<h5>Phoenix</h5>
<p>Detective Columbo didn’t look for clues, but talked to suspects to induce them to explain by feigning ignorance until he irritated them into a confession.
A checklist of questions helps you ensure no aspect of a challenge is overlooked.
Unless you have an easy challenge, you need to know what to ask.
The CIA created the Phoenix checklist of questions to look from multiple angles.</p>

<h5>The Great Transpacific Airline and Storm Door Company</h5>
<p>We don’t see stars in motion, though they move fast. Same with the world of business. Know what your business is AND what it should be to get effective new ideas for it.
“What is our business” is a hard question.
Bell Telephone: “Our business is service, not telephones.”
Define and organize your business according to products, services, markets, functions, technologies. Under each variable, list keywords. Mix and match to explore new ideas.</p>

<h5>Future Fruit</h5>
<p>“In peace prepare for war, in war prepare for peace.” — Sun Tzu
We are all traveling toward the future at 60 min per hour. — the author
When we try to think into the future, we think of the past.
Blueprint:
ID a problem and a decision that must be made
ID the forces that may impact the decision (economic, tech, product lines, competition, etc)
Build 4–5 future scenarios based on the principal forces
Develop the scenarios into narratives by varying the forces that impact the decision
Look for opportunities in each scenario
You need specific scenarios to enable you to deal with local possibilities immediately. People who are fired are unable to cope for a few months because they have no local plans on how to survive.</p>

</div>

<div class="group-c">
<h5 id="brute">Brutethink</h5>
<p>In art, it’s common to juxtapose unrelated objects to provoke new ideas.
The brain can’t deliberately concentrate on two separate objects/ideas without eventually forming a connection between them.
Blueprint: Take 5 minutes
Bring in a random word using a dictionary, table, etc. The best words are simple and familiar, visual, connection-rich. like soap, soup, sand.
Think of a variety of things associated with your chosen word.
Force connections. State your challenge and see how it relates to your word. Play with noun/verb relationships. Collect and store ideas like a pack rat.
You can try this idea with magazine articles and shapes too.</p>

<h5>Hall of Fame</h5>
<p>Gain insights into your challenges by consulting the world’s great minds, real or fictional.
Look up quotes: Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations, Edward’s Dictionary of Thoughts. Or collect your own quotes and categorize them if you want.
Blueprint:
Create your personal Hall of Fame — people who appeal to you
When you have a challenge, consult the hall of fame and choose a quote
Ponder the quote.
Restate the thought/s that have most promise
Give yourself 5–10 minutes to come up with new ideas.
Board of directors blueprint:
Choose 3–5 business movers and shakers, living or dead, whom you most admire
Get photos and pin them on your wall. Research these heroes. Take notes on your favorite passages.
When you have a challenge, imagine how these people would handle it.</p>

<h5>Circle of Opportunity</h5>
<p>Blueprint
State the challenge
Draw a clock
Select 12 common attributes specific to your challenge and write them on the numbers
Throw a dice to decide the first attribute to focus on
Then throw two dice to choose the second attribute
Consider the attributes separately and combined</p>

<h5>Ideatoons</h5>
<p>Visual and verbal thinking complement each other.
Pattern language is a visual thinking technique invented by architects Alexander, Ishikawa, Silverstein. It uses abstract visual symbols to substitute for words.
Blueprint:
Divide your challenge into attributes
Describe each one by drawing an abstract graphic symbol
Place all graphic symbols face up and regroup them randomly
Look for ideas. Add more ideatoons as necessary.
Idea: you can use this to draft a speech!</p>

<h5>Clever Trevor</h5>
<p>Sometimes the only test of a brilliant idea is whether or not “experts” discount it. Experts often fail to understand new ideas.
Specialization: the more expert you get in your field, the more difficult it is to create innovative ideas.
Experts draw borders on their thinking. Nonexperts don’t.
Blueprint:
Talk to someone outside your field/background about your ideas. Listen carefully.
Judge content, not delivery. Resist distractions. Know that thought is faster than speech, listen between he lines to tone.</p>
</div>

<h2>INTUITIVE THINKER TOYS</h2>
 <div class="intuitive-games">

<h5>Chilling Out</h5>
<p>Blueprint:
Get a quiet environment
Have a specific mental technique for relaxing
Be passive, in a comfortable position where you can be still without falling asleep
Remember times when you felt most relaxed. Imagine your body as jello. President Truman had a foxhole in his mind. You can create your own inner sanctuary too.
Visualize: a hot air balloon, taking off your mental block like a piece of clothing, feeling warm stones making your body heavier.</p>

<h5>Blue Roses</h5>
<p>Story of a princess who said she would only marry someone who brought her a blue rose. The man she fell in love with brought a white rose, which she declared a blue rose, and they got married.
Pay attention to your feelings. But combine intuition with reason.</p>

<h5>The Three B’s</h5>
<p>A physicist once said all great scientific discoveries were made in bed, bath, or bus. In other words, when you are not thinking about solving problems. This is thanks to incubation.
So pick your challenge, prepare your info/material, tell your brain to find the solution, incubate/let go of the problem, and let intuition work.</p>

<h5>Rattlesnakes and Roses</h5>
<p>Analogies: comparing similar features of two things. Like hummingbirds and helicopters.
Use analogies to generate ideas, and you’ll find analogies growing. We like to make the strange familiar. To be creative, do the opposite.
Blueprint:
State your challenge
Choose a key word or phrase in the challenge
Choose a parallel or distant field
List images associated with your chosen field
Look for similarities/connections/analogies
Your imagination needs nourishment. Imagine a fantasy world with no reference to objective reality. Combine types of analogies.</p>

<h5>Stone Soup</h5>
<p>Ask “what if” ad “just suppose.” Anything goes if you’re only limited by your imagination. It’s the crux of every human perception. Humor uses imagination to create new insights.
State your challenge and list as many what if’s as you can. Ask imaginative questions.</p>

<h5>True and False</h5>
<p>Think in terms of contradictions and paradoxes: “a man from Crete said all Crete-ans are liars.” This is how Pasteur discovered the principle of immunology.
Think in terms of simultaneous opposites: “I want X without Y” “How to make money when you’re too lazy to work.” Other examples: lead by following, win by losing, be conservative in taking risks, etc.
Blueprint:
Convert your problem into a paradox. What is the opposite/contradiction of the problem? Imagine both existing at the same time.
What’s the essence of the problem? Summarize it into a book title.
Find an analogy that reflects that essence.
Any unique features for this analogy?
Use an equivalent of this unique feature to trigger new insights.
Instead of either/or, think both/and.
Ex: Dr. Randas Batista created a procedure of cutting of bits of the heart to treat congestive heart failure, by making hearts smaller so they can beat stronger.</p>

<h5>Dreamscape</h5>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson, Rene Descartes, Niels Bohr, James Watt, Dmirti Mendeleyev, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Elias Howe all dreamed before they created.
Record your dreams. Ask if any aspect of the dream is related to your problem. Free-associate.</p>

<h5>Da Vinci’s Technique</h5>
<p>Da Vinci closed his eyes, relaxed, and covered a piece of paper with random scribbles. Then he’d look for images, patterns, objects, faces in the scribble.
Graphic ideation is complementary to verbal ideation.
Idea: draw freely, then write a paragraph about it, then see how what you wrote relates to your challenge.</p>

<h5>Dali’s Technique</h5>
<p>Hypnogogic imagery: Produces autonomous inner imagery captured just before you fall asleep.
Salvador Dali would start to sleep in a chair, holding a spoon over a plate. When he dozed and the spoon hit the plate, he’d wake up and capture the surreal images.</p>

<h5>Not Kansas</h5>
<p>Technique:
Relax
Ask unconscious for answer to your problem
Take a guided imagery journey
Accept whatever messages emerge
Use your imagination to make the images as clear and vivid as you can and record/draw them immediately.
Just ask:
Formulate a challenge
Address it to your unconscious
Ask for the answer to emerge as a mental image
The 3 doors:
Imagine you’re standing before a series of doors, one behind the other. Visualize yourself opening the doors one at a time and then write what you saw, felt, and did.</p>

<h5>The Shadow</h5>
<p>When you focus on your conscious mind, you are blind to the value of the unconscious.
When you name something, you create expectations and change your perceptions. You give us figure meaning by naming it. Once you have named it is impossible to look at it and have the same perception you had before.
Similarly, you can organize the irregular shapes of your unconscious by personifying your unconscious. This technique is called Psychosynthesis.
Ex: Douglas MacArthur used to talk to the personification of his father.
Imagine the face of a wise older man or woman who loves you and talk to them. Write down what they say. You can also imagine someone Alive or Dead, real or fictional.</p>

<h5>The Book of the Dead</h5>
<p>Based on Prof Michael Ray, Stanford Business school’s idea. Using heiroglyphic lines from the Book of the Dead.
Write out the challenge you want to solve
Choose 1 of 3 sets of heiroglyphs
Write out the challenge again
Concentrate and meditate on the problem for a few minutes
“Translate” each line of the heiroglyphs
As you interpret it, free-associate and write out interpretations
The point is: unusual external images can refresh a stale imagination.
Note from S: Maybe this can work with other pictographic lines, like Japanese?</p>
