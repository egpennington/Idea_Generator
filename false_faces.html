Edison did not hire people who salted their suit before tasting it. He didn’t like people who had too many assumptions built into life.

Ask how to accomplish each reversal. List as many ideas as possible. The goal is not to find one right answer, but look at different ways to view existing info.
Alfred Sloan helped General Motors turn around by pioneering the idea of installment buying for cars.
